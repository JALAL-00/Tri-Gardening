## üåü Overview

This repository contains the backend API for **TriGardening**, a comprehensive e-commerce platform designed for selling gardening supplies. The API is built with a modern, scalable, and secure architecture using **NestJS**, **TypeScript**, and **PostgreSQL**.

This project was developed as a technical task for the Backend Developer Intern position at **ShafaCode**. It demonstrates a robust, feature-complete backend system that powers a public-facing website, a customer account section, and a full-featured admin panel.

## ‚ú® Features

The API is structured into three main user experiences, each with a rich set of features.

### üë§ **Public User (No Authentication Required)**
- **Product Discovery:** Browse a full catalog of products with advanced, multi-parameter filtering (category, tags, price range, search query) and pagination.
- **Detailed Views:** Get detailed information for a single product, including its variants (sizes, prices) and all approved customer reviews.
- **Content Consumption:** Read blog posts from the "Gardening Journal," paginated for easy browsing.
- **Category & Tag Listing:** Fetch lists of all available categories and tags to populate frontend navigation and filters.
- **Dynamic Homepage:** A single, efficient endpoint (`/page-content/home`) aggregates all necessary data for the main homepage, including featured products, popular products, and top categories.

### üë®‚Äçüíº **Registered Customer (Customer Role)**
- **Full Authentication:** Secure registration, login, and an OTP-based password reset flow via email.
- **Profile Management:** Customers can view their profile, update personal information, and securely change their password.
- **Address Book:** Full CRUD functionality for managing multiple shipping addresses.
- **Order Management:** Place new orders (checkout) and view a complete history of past orders. The API ensures users can only access their own data.
- **Review System:** Submit product reviews, which are then queued for admin approval.

- **Order Management:** View a list of all customer orders with filtering (by date, status) and update order statuses (e.g., from "processing" to "shipped").
- **Content Management:** Full CRUD for blog posts.
- **User Moderation:** View a list of all registered customers.
- **Review Moderation:** List, filter (by pending/approved status), approve, and delete customer-submitted reviews. Add official replies to reviews.
